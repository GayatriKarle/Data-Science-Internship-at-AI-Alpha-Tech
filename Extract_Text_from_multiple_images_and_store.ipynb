The SARS-CoV-2 E protein reveals similar amino acid constitution without any substitution (16). N Protein The N protein   of coronavirus is  multipurpose. Among several functions, it plays a role in complex formation with the viral genome, facilitates M protein interaction needed virion   assembly, and enhances the transcription efficiency of the virus (55, 56). It   contains three highly conserved and distinct domains, namely, an NTD, an RNA-binding domain or linker region (LKR), and CTD (57). The NTD binds with the 3' end of the viral genome perhaps  via   electrostatic interactions, and is highly diverged both in   length and   sequence (58). The charged LKR is serine and arginine rich and is also known as the SR (serine and arginine) domain (59). The LKR is capable of direct interaction with in vitro RNA interaction and is responsible for cell signaling (60, 61)_ It also modulates the antiviral response of the host by working as an antagonist for interferon large during\n",
