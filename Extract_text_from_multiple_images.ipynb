SARS is a viral respiratory disease caused by formerly  unrecognized animal CoV that originated from the wet markets in southern China after adapting to the human host, thereby   enabling transmission between humans (90). The SARS outbreak reported in 2002 to 2003 had 8,098 confirmed cases with 774 total deaths (9.6%) (93). The outbreak severely affected the Asia Pacific especially mainland China (94). Even though the case fatality rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is lower than that of SARS-CoV, there exists a severe concern linked to this outbreak due to its   epidemiological   similarity to influenza viruses (95, 279).  This can fail  the public health system_ resulting in a pandemic (96)  MERS is another   respiratory disease  that was first reported in Saudi Arabia during the year 2012. The disease was found to have a CFR of around 35% (97). The analysis of available data sets suggests that the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV is in almost the same range. The longest predicted incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 is 14 days.   Hence, suspected individuals are   isolated for 14 to avoid the risk of further spread (98).

This virus has been proposed to be designated/named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on   Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which determined the virus belongs to the Severe acute respiratory   syndrome-related coronavirus category and found this virus is related to SARS-CoVs (26). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which is subdivided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus_ Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (3, 27). The genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus originate from bats, while Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus have evolved from bird and swine gene (24,28,29,275) Coronaviruses possess an unsegmented,  single- stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of around 30 kb, enclosed by a 5'-cap and 3'-poly(A) tail (30).

Immunoinformatics methods have been employed for the genome-wide screening of potential vaccine targets   among the different immunogens of MERS-CoV (178). The N protein and the potential B-cell epitopes of MERS- CoV E protein have been suggested as immunoprotective targets inducing both T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses (178,179). The collaborative effort of the researchers of Mountain Laboratories and Oxford University is designing chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine to counter COVID-19 (180). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has initiated three programs to design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (181).

The recent increase in the number of confirmed critically ill patients with COVID-19 has already surpassed the intensive care supplies, limiting intensive care services to only small portion of critically ill patients (67). This might also have contributed to the increased case fatality rate observed in the COVID-19 outbreak. Viewpoint on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission; Spread, and Emergence The   novel   coronavirus was   identified within month (28 days) of the outbreak This is impressively fast  compared to the time taken to identify SARS- CoV   reported in Foshan; Guangdong Province, China (125 days) (68). Immediately after the confirmation of viral etiology; the Chinese virologists rapidly released the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which played crucial role in controlling the spread of this newly emerged novel coronavirus to other   parts of the world (69). The possible origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the first mode of We assessed the nucleotide   percent   similarity the   MegAlign   software   program, where    the similarity between the novel SARS-CoV-2 isolates was in the range of 99.4% to 100%. Among the other Serbecovirus CoV sequences, the novel SARS-CoV- 2 sequences revealed the highest similarity to bat- SL-CoV with nucleotide percent  identity ranges between 88.12 and 89.65%. Meanwhile, earlier reported SARS-CoVs showed 70.6 to 74.9% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide level_ Further; the nucleotide percent similarity was 55.4%, 45.5% to 47.9%, 46.2%/ to 46.6%, and 45.0% to 46.3% to the other four subgenera, namely; Hibecovirus, Nobecovirus, Merbecovirus_ and Embecovirus,  respectively: The   percent   similarity index of current outbreak isolates indicates close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and bat- SL-CoV,   indicating common origin: However; particular pieces of evidence based on further complete  genomic   analysis of current  isolates are necessary to draw any conclusions, although it was ascertained that the current novel SARS-CoV-2 isolates belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus in the diverse  range of betacoronaviruses.
